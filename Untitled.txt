Section II: Investment Objective and Risk Tolerance
1. Select the investment objective that most accurately reflects the goals for this account: (choose only one)
The investment objectives, account goal, and risk tolerance are overall objectives for the entire account and may be inconsistent with a particular holding
at any time. Please note that achievement of the stated investment objectives or account goal is a long-term goal for the account. These choices are listed
in order from what is considered to be conservative to highest risk - ask your financial advisor for more details. There is no guarantee that the investment
objective or account goal will be achieved.
O A. Income with Capital Preservation. Designed as a longer term accumulation account, this is considered generally the most conservative investment
objective. Emphasis is placed on generation of current income with minimal risk of capital loss. Lowering the risk generally means lowering the
potential income and overall return.
OB. Income with Moderate Growth. Emphasis is placed on generation of current income with a secondary focus on moderate capital growth.
O C. Growth with Income. Emphasis is placed on modest capital growth with some focus on generation of current income.
0 D. Growth. Emphasis is placed on achieving high long-term growth and capital appreciation. There is little focus on generation of current income.
OE. Aggressive Growth. Emphasis is placed on aggressive growth and maximum capital appreciation. No focus on generation of current income. This
objective has a very high level of risk and is for investors with a longer time horizon.
ATTENTION: If you select an objective and cross it out to choose another, the change must be initialed by all account holders.

I have reviewed this document for completeness, accuracy, suitability, and proper disclosures. If this account was opened online and the automated check
against the OFAC list of specially designated nationals (SDNs) resulted in a match to the account holder's name, I have confirmed that the account holder
is not the same person listed by OFAC. If this account is opened by the home office, I have checked the list of SON: and either the account holder's name
does not appear or, if the account holder's name is the same as the name of a SON, the account holder is not the person listed by OFAC. I have also
provided the account holder with the OP disclosure either in writing or verbally. I acknowledge and accept that I am a party to the Account Agreement. In
the event the enrolling client does not have sufficient credit history in order to generate DocuSign knowledge-based authentication questions, I certify that
the client already maintains an existing relationship with LPL and me, or that I have met this client in person and reviewed the Customer Identification
Program (CIP) information outlined in Section III. For MAN, MWP, OMP, PWP and GWP accounts, I acknowledge and accept that I am a party to the
applicable Account Agreement. I have determined that any liquidation of previously purchased investments to deposit assets into this account is suitable
for the account holder and have disclosed to the account holder all costs incurred by the account holder to liquidate such investments.
