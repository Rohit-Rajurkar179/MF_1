Section II: Investment Objective and Risk Tolerance

1. Select the investment objective that most accurately reflects the goals for this account (choose only one)
The investment objectives, account goal, and risk tolerance are overall objectives for the entire account and may be inconsistent with a particular holding
at any time. Please note that achievement of the stated investment objectives or account goal is a long-term goal for the account. These choices are listed
in order from what is considered to be conservative to highest risk - ask your financial advisor for more details. There is no guarantee that the investment
objective or account goal will be achieved.
A. Income with Capital Preservation. Designed as a longer term accumulation account, this is considered generally the most conservative investment
objective. Emphasis is placed on generation of current income with minimal risk of capital loss. Lowering the risk generally means lowering the
potential income and overall return.

B. Income with Moderate Growth. Emphasis is placed on generation of current income with a secondary focus on moderate capital growth.

C. Growth with Income. Emphasis is placed on modest capital growth with some focus on generation of current income.

D. Growth. Emphasis is placed on achieving high long-term growth and capital appreciation. There is little focus on generation of current income.

E. Aggressive Growth. Emphasis is placed on aggressive growth and maximum capital appreciation. No focus on generation of current income. This
objective has a very high level of risk and is for investors with a longer time horizon.

ATTENTION: If you select an objective and cross it out to choose another, the change must be initialed by all account

2. Beneficiary Designation (This section only applies to accounts with PTC as custodian; also excludes Trusteed IRA account. For all Trusteed IRA accounts,
complete the Trusteed IRA Beneficiary Designation form (F780)):

Marital Status: Single Married

I hereby designate the following individual(s) or entity(ies) as my primary and/or contingent beneficiary(ies) unless otherwise directed in writing by the
account holder and properly filed with the custodian. If neither primary nor contingent is indicated, the individual or entity will be deemed to be a primary
beneficiary. If more than one primary beneficiary is designated and no distribution percentages are indicated, or the percentages do not total 100%, the
beneficiaries will be deemed to own equal share of the unspecified percentages in the account. If more than one contingent beneficiary is designated and
no distribution percentages are indicated, or the percentages do not total 100%, the beneficiaries will be deemed to own equal share of the unspecified
percentages in the account. If this is a Guardian account, the account will automatically pass to the minor's estate. Once the minor has reached the age of
majority for the state of residence, he or she may then designate a beneficiary(ies).
LPL generally will divide all securities and cash in my account proportionately among the designated beneficiaries based on the allocations indicated
herein; provided that LPL will seek to maintain fixed income minimum denomination in lot sizes sufficient to meet any minimum trading requirements (per
issuers' requirements). In the event that any securities remain after such proportionate division of assets and the market value of each such remaining
security is less than or equal to $50.00, LPL will distribute such remaining shares/bonds to the first primary beneficiary listed herein. In the event that any
securities remain after such proportionate division of assets and the market value of each such security is greater than $50.00, LPL will use reasonable
efforts to liquidate such remaining shares/bonds and divide the proceeds proportionately among the beneficiaries based on the allocations indicated
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LPL will use reasonable efforts to liquidate all remaining fixed income securities and divide the proceeds
proportionately among the beneficiaries based on the allocations indicated herein.

In the event that a designated beneficiary dies, you may select whether distributions will be made to other remaining beneficiaries or to your beneficiary's heirs.
Â· Pro Rata (Default Rule) -- Unless Per Stirpes is indicated below, the following Pro Rata rule will be in place at my death. If any primary beneficiary(ies)
dies before me, his or her interest shall terminate completely, and the percentage share of any remaining primary beneficiary (ies) shall be increased
equally. If no primary beneficiary survives me, the contingent beneficiary(ies) shall acquire the designated share of my account. If no primary or
contingent beneficiaries survive me, my spouse will be deemed my beneficiary. If there is no surviving spouse at the time of my death, my estate will
be deemed my beneficiary. If I live in a state with community property statutes or the account is a 403(b)(7) subject to Title 1 of ERISA and do not
designate my spouse as the sole primary beneficiary, I certify that my spouse has consented to such designation.

. Per Stirpes -- If any primary beneficiary dies before me, my estate will need to identify the heirs who are to receive that primary beneficiary's share of
my TOD assets. If no primary beneficiary with the per stirpes designation survives me, that beneficiary's share shall be paid to the living descendants
of such beneficiary, subject to state law. The percentage share of the remaining primary beneficiaries will remain the same.

connection with opening this account
. If you decide to transfer assets out of the plan and into an IRA, you understand that:
o Those assets will no longer be subject to the protections of ERISA or other applicable pension laws
o There will no longer be a responsible plan fiduciary making decisions about the investments

remained in your plan, and your Financial Advisor may receive more compensation for servicing your IRA than if you selected a different option.

o You reviewed and understand the above information regarding rollovers, including the pros and cons and other information contained in the IRA
Custodial Agreement or Trust Agreement and other documents required to open this account

o Your Financial Advisor only provides education regarding the options available to transfer or roll your Plan assets to an IRA, and does not
recommend one option over another

6. Branch Use Only

I have reviewed this document for completeness, accuracy, suitability, and proper disclosures. If this account was opened online and the automated check
against the OFAC list of specially designated nationals (SDNs) resulted in a match to the account holder's name, I have confirmed that the account holder
is not the same person listed by OFAC. If this account is opened by the home office, I have checked the list of SDNs and either the account holder's name
does not appear or, if the account holder's name is the same as the name of a SDN, the account holder is not the person listed by OFAC. I have also
provided the account holder with the CIP disclosure either in writing or verbally. I acknowledge and accept that I am a party to the Account Agreement. In
the event the enrolling client does not have sufficient credit history in order to generate DocuSign knowledge-based authentication questions, I certify that
the client already maintains an existing relationship with LPL and me, or that I have met this client in person and reviewed the Customer Identification
Program (CIP) information outlined in Section III. For MWP, OMP, PWP and GWP accounts, I acknowledge and accept that I am a party to the applicable
Account Agreement. I have determined that any liquidation of previously purchased investments to deposit assets into this account is suitable for the
account holder and have disclosed to the account holder all costs incurred by the account holder to liquidate such investments.
